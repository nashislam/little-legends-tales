  return `Once upon a time, there was a ${childAge}-year-old child named ${childName} who loved ${favoriteAnimal}s more than anything in the world.

${childName} had a special secret - the ability to ${magicalPower === 'flying' ? 'fly high in the sky' : 
  magicalPower === 'talking-to-animals' ? 'talk to animals' :
  magicalPower === 'invisibility' ? 'turn invisible whenever they wanted' :
  magicalPower === 'super-strength' ? 'lift heavy things with amazing strength' :
  magicalPower === 'time-travel' ? 'travel through time to any moment' :
  magicalPower === 'shape-shifting' ? 'transform into any creature' :
  magicalPower === 'healing' ? 'heal others with a gentle touch' :
  'do amazing magical things'}.

One sunny morning, ${childName} was playing in the garden when a magical ${favoriteAnimal} appeared. The ${favoriteAnimal} had sparkling eyes and a friendly smile.

"Hello, ${childName}," said the ${favoriteAnimal}. "My name is Sparkle, and I need your help. The Enchanted Forest is in danger, and only someone with your special powers can save it."

${childName} was excited but a little nervous. "What do I need to do?" they asked.

"We must journey to the heart of the forest and find the Crystal of Colors before sunset," explained Sparkle.

${childName} called ${characters || 'their friends'} to join the adventure. Together, they packed some snacks and set off toward the mysterious forest.

Along the way, they encountered a rushing river. "How will we cross?" asked ${characters.split(',')[0] || 'a friend'}.

${childName} smiled and said, "I can help!" Using ${childName}'s magical power, they ${
  magicalPower === 'flying' ? 'flew everyone across the river one by one' : 
  magicalPower === 'talking-to-animals' ? 'called some friendly fish to help them cross safely' :
  magicalPower === 'invisibility' ? 'turned everyone invisible so they could walk across the secret underwater bridge' :
  magicalPower === 'super-strength' ? 'lifted a fallen tree to create a bridge for everyone' :
  magicalPower === 'time-travel' ? 'took everyone back in time to when there was a bridge across the river' :
  magicalPower === 'shape-shifting' ? 'transformed into a huge bridge so everyone could walk across' :
  magicalPower === 'healing' ? 'healed the broken old bridge so everyone could cross safely' :
  'used their magic to help everyone cross'
}.

Deep in the forest, they found a clearing filled with glowing flowers. In the center stood a tall crystal that changed colors in the sunlight.

"That's the Crystal of Colors!" exclaimed Sparkle. "But it's guarded by the Grumpy Troll who never lets anyone near it."

Just then, a large troll appeared from behind the crystal. "Who dares enter my clearing?" he bellowed.

${childName} stepped forward bravely. "We need the crystal to save the Enchanted Forest," they explained kindly.

The troll looked surprised. No one had ever been so polite to him before. "Well," he said, scratching his head, "I suppose I could let you borrow it, but you must promise to bring it back tomorrow."

${childName} promised, and the troll carefully handed over the crystal. As soon as ${childName} touched it, the crystal glowed brighter than ever before!

With the crystal in hand, ${childName}, ${characters || 'their friends'}, and Sparkle hurried back to the edge of the forest. They placed the crystal on a special stone, and immediately, magic spread throughout the forest, restoring its beauty and magic.

All the creatures of the forest gathered to thank ${childName} for their bravery and kindness. The ${favoriteAnimal} king declared ${childName} an honorary guardian of the Enchanted Forest.

As the sun set, ${childName} and ${characters || 'their friends'} returned home, tired but happy. ${childName}'s parents asked, "Did you have a good day playing?"

${childName} just smiled and said, "It was magical!"

And whenever ${childName} wanted to visit their friends in the Enchanted Forest, all they had to do was call for Sparkle the ${favoriteAnimal}, and a new adventure would begin.

The End.`;
